## Burger Time
Hungry for a burger? You're in luck! Well, at least if you like virtual burgers ;)

## Description
The user is able to do 3 things - 
1) Type in any burger of their choosing - don't hesitate to get creative!
2) From the Burgers list, they can click on the Eat Me! button, and the burger will display below in the Devoured section.
3) From the Devoured section, the user can click on the I Want More button and the burger will appear again on the main menu. An endless cycle of delicious - and nutrious - and hopefully creative! - burgers

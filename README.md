## Burger Time
Hungry for a burger? You're in luck! Well, at least if you like virtual burgers ;)

## Description
The user is able to do 3 things - 
1) Type in any burger of their choosing - don't hesitate to get creative!
2) From the Burgers list, they can click on the Eat Me! button, and the burger will display below in the Devoured section.
3) From the Devoured section, the user can click on the I Want More button and the burger will appear again on the main menu. An endless cycle of delicious - and nutrious - and hopefully creative! - burgers

## Feedback
At this time the app is not finished - the styling can be improved, and there is a hiccup when the user clicks submit - they are re-directed to a new page. This will be fixed very soon and I will update this section of the readme. However - the new burger DOES display on the page - a simple refresh is all that's needed.
